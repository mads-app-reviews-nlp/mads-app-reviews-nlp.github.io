# Background
Food delivery apps have become an integral part of many people’s daily lives. From the perspective of food delivery companies, understanding and catering to the needs of millions are no easy feat. At the same time, the food delivery business is extremely competitive, making the task to understand and measure a customer’s “happiness meter” to the platform is even more imminent. 
In this project, we would like to leverage the power of natural language processing to achieve two goals. Firstly, how do customers feel about various food delivery platforms, and do these sentiments vary over time and locations? And secondly, what are the primary topics that customers write about on these reviews? Getting a low rating says very little about why that customer is deciding to give that rating, rather, we need to understand and mine the pain points that are driving the customers’ decisions. Understanding them gives us a view of the strengths of different food delivery platforms, while also potentially identifying the pain points of each.
